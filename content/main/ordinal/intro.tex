\dsea{} can solve the deconvolution problem
given any capable classifier.
However,
  classifiers usually do not take into account \emph{ordinality},
which contradicts the physical meaning of the unfolded spectrum.
%
This chapter
  clarifies the concept of ordinality
  and
  introduces the \ac{CORN} algorithm,
    which applies it to neural networks.
    % which makes neural networks ordinal
    %   with small modifications.
