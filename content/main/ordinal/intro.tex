The \textsc{Dsea} algorithm provides everything needed to solve the deconvolution problem.
However,
it uses an arbitrary \emph{classifier}.
Usually,
  classifiers have no concept of \emph{ordinality},
which contradicts the physical meaning of the problem.
%
This chapter
  clarifies the concept of ordinality
  and
  introduces the \textsc{Corn} algorithm,
    which applies the concept of ordinality to neural networks.
