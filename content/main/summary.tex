\chapter{Summary and outlook}
% should be 1 page

There is still a multitude of ways in which DSEA and the application thereof could be improved.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Regularization / smoothing
  \item Optimization of other hyperparameters, such as the shape of the neural network
\end{itemize}

A benefit of neural networks is their good performance on \enquote{raw} data.
However,
the present work has relied on a preprocessing step % aka feature engineering
  – the computation of features like angles and cone fits –
that is not necessarily required.
Given an adequate neural network architecture and sufficient computing power,
it might be possible to train a neural network directly on the raw data.
