\section{Setup}

\subsection{Dataset}
The unmodified dataset consists of about 13 million Monte-Carlo simulated \enquote{upgoing} neutrino events,
% NOTE: Exact number is 13336413 before any preprocessing.
with energies ranging from \SI{100}{\giga\electronvolt} to almost \SI{1E8}{\giga\electronvolt}.
See \autoref{fig:dataset:raw:histogram} for a histogram of the data.

To ensure comparability to \cite{dsea_samuel},
\num{500000} events are used for training.
