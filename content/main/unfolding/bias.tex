\section{Bias}
\textsc{Dsea} is intended to eliminate the bias introduced by the Monte-Carlo-simulated energy spectrum.

In order to test
whether the bias is indeed eliminated,
the model is trained on a \emph{stratified} dataset,
% TODO: explain that dataset: number of events etc.
where each bin contains an equal number of events.
The model is then evaluated on the unmodified dataset.
% TODO: Make clear that train/test data don't overlap
% TODO: This is the opposite of what I did earlier. But it matches what Samuel does. Both should be fine.

The results are shown in \autoref{fig:bias_comparison}.
As can be seen,
only a small bias remains:
The model adapts to the unseen distribution of the test data.
… in comparison to \autoref{fig:bootstrap:spectrum}.

In the work by \citeauthor{dsea_samuel},
relative deviations of more than \SI{1500}{\percent} are observed \cite{dsea_samuel}.
% Aber er schiebt's auf die geringe Accuracy…
